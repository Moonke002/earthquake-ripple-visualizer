Earthquake Ripple Visualizer

A fully interactive earthquake simulation tool built with **HTML5 Canvas**, **JavaScript**, and live global seismic data from the **USGS Earthquake API**.

Users can click anywhere to generate shockwave ripples, rotate the map horizontally, and visualize real recent earthquakes with animated markers and intelligent tooltips.

Features
Interactive Simulation
- Click to create expanding earthquake shockwaves  
- Drag horizontally to “spin” the world map (wrap-around globe effect)  
- Smooth animations using `requestAnimationFrame`  

Real-Time Earthquake Data
- Pulls live M2.5+ earthquake data from USGS  
- Each quake includes:
  - Magnitude  
  - Location  
  - Timestamp  
  - Depth  
- Hover tooltips remain perfectly anchored near markers  

Adjustable Controls
- Magnitude (3.0–9.0)  
- Depth (0–700 km)  
- Ripple speed (0.5×–3×)  
- Toggle recent quakes  
- Auto-ripple mode (plays through real events)  

Canvas Rendering
- Efficient, lightweight, framework-free front-end  
- Gradient ripple effects  
- Earthquake markers rotate with the map  
- No external libraries required  

Tech Stack
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **HTML5 Canvas**
- **CSS3**
- **USGS Earthquake GeoJSON Feed**
- No backend required  
- No build tools required
